# BASIC-games
These are some of my very first programs that I ever made! They are written in BASIC and use an IDE called Blitz3D, which is now availible for free. You're welcome to pull them down and tweak them in any way you want. Being some of my first work, they aren't written very well. There is an executable inside each one that you can run. They will only run on Windows. `Matrix` and `Fish Tank` were made to be screen savers. Enjoy!
